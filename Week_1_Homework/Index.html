	<h2>All About Me</h2>

	<p>What can I say...I signed up for this web development course and I have to write this as part of my assignment.  Since I"m on a break from work, most of my free time these days is spent with my new puppy, Lola.</p>

	<p>Lola loves nothing more than to bite my hands and check out the latest updates on her Twitter account. You can follow @LolaZodi<a href="https://twitter.com/LolaZodi"> here</a></p>

	<p>Traveling is a big part of my life. In addition to be a Francophile, I am always searching for the perfect Caribbean beach. <a href="http://www.flickriver.com/photos/weedmandan/3264580194"> Trunk Bay</a> in St. John is defintely one of my top 5 beaches. </p>
